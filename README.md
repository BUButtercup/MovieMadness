## Description of Product
Our platform, MovieMadness, is a one-stop shop to find information about your favorite flicks. You can search for your favorite title directly or browse suggestions based of a genre of your choosing. If you’re not sure what you’re looking for, use our randomizer to suggest a title from our staff’s favorite films! Once you find the movie you’re looking for, you’ll be presented with details about the film and can request  a cocktail pairing to enjoy while you watch!
